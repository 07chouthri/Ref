1.What is JavaScript?
   JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. 
      It is widely used.
      Interpreted means  (JavaScript runs line by line at runtime).
      Web Development (dynamic and interactive websites)
      App Development (both web and mobile applications)
      Game Development (browser-based games)
      AI & Machine Learning (with libraries like TensorFlow.js)
      Backend Development (using Node.js)



    



2.JavaScript's History?
         It was born in 1995.
         It was created by Brendan Eich.
         The initial name was Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript (to capitalize on Javaâ€™s popularity).





3.Finding the Type of a Variable?
   typeof variable; 





4.Equality vs. Strict Equality?
   5 == '5'   // true (loose comparison, type coercion occurs)  
   5 === '5'  // false (strict comparison, type must also match)  




5.Inequality Operators?
   5 !== '5'  // true (different types: number vs. string)  
   5 !== 5    // false (same value and type) 






6.Loose Inequality?
    5 != '5'   // false (type coercion makes both equal)  
    5 != 3     // true (different values)  
 





7.Checking if a Variable is an Array?
   let ArrayCheck = [];
   console.log(Array.isArray(ArrayCheck) ? [] : {});  






8.Object Property?
let data = {
  "Gam": "Chourhri",
  "Age": 20,
  "Class": 12
};
console.log('Data:', data);
console.log(Object.keys(data)); // ["Gam", "Age", "Class"]
console.log(Object.values(data)); // ["Chourhri", 20, 12]
// Other methods of Object
console.log(Object.entries(data)); // [["Gam", "Chourhri"], ["Age", 20], ["Class", 12]]
console.log(Object.hasOwnProperty.call(data, 'Age')); // true
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(data)); // ["Gam", "Age", "Class"]
console.log(Object.freeze(data)); // Freezes the object, preventing modifications
console.log(Object.isFrozen(data)); // true

   





9.Key Skill?
let a = 0;
let b = "Fallback value";
// Using || (Logical OR)
let result1 = a || b;
console.log(result1); // Output: "Fallback value" (because 0 is falsy)
 
// Using ?? (Nullish Coalescing Operator)
let result2 = a ?? b;
console.log(result2); // Output: 0 (because 0 is not null or undefined)
