CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
(or Continuous Deployment), and itâ€™s a set of practices used 
in software development to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, 
and deploying code.

Continuous Integration (CI) involves frequently 
integrating code changes into a shared repository. 
Every time new code is pushed, automated tests run to 
catch bugs or issues early, ensuring that new changes
don't break the existing code.(Automate Work)

Continuous Delivery (CD) automates the process 
of deploying code to a production environment. 
This ensures that code is always in a deployable state and can be 
released quickly with minimal manual intervention.(Maual Work)


(Git) is a version control system for tracking changes in your code.
